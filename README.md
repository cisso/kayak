# Kayak

Drupal 8 provides a complex framework of classes and interfaces that can easily overwhelm new developers. While tutorials cover some of these for certain scenarios, a lot of the low-level tools provided by Drupal Core can remain hidden because no straight-forward examples of their use exist.

Kayak will provide a web frontend to quickly navigate through the Drupal code base and gain a bird's-eye perspective. It will visualize hierarchies and dependencies and explain when and where to use each class or interface.

Given the vast number of core files a joint effort is required. The Kayak project will therefore allow users to add and revise examples.
